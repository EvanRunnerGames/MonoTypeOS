alpha02:
This is the update that added the terminal look like a linux terminal kinda where you have the users name
but here is the code that made it happen, ui = input(f'termilink#{Fore.BLUE}{user}{orange}~ ').lower().strip()
but also fixed bug fixes and also changed to boot screen to just say BOOTING... while checking for needed system files
then restarts the terminal and boots into system function, but also reduced the ammount of libres used and lines
of code alpha01 used 703 lines of code but alpha02 reduced that just to 192 lines of code.

alpha01: 
This is the oldest version and the first of termliink having the most basic things like file creation file reading and games
